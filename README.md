Last week, we wrapped up an incredible hackathon at [Irembo](@Irembo), where competition was fierce and the talent was inspiring! Our team built something truly special: an **AI Healthcare Assistant** designed to empower Rwandans by giving them access to medical guidance **in their own language**—whether by voice or text.  

**Here’s how it works:**  
**Local-Language AI:** Patients describe symptoms in **Kinyarwanda**, and our system translates queries for LLMs (like LLaMA 70B) and back—making AI as accessible as it is in English.  
**Seamless Doctor Connect:** If a patient is unsure about the AI’s response, one click connects them to a **specialist doctor**. The AI **summarizes the case**, so no manual typing is needed—just fast, human backup when required.  
 **Urgency Detection:** For critical cases, the system flags doctors to **call immediately**, bridging the gap between AI and live care.  

**Why This Matters:**  
 **No more language barriers** – healthcare advice shouldn’t require fluency in English.  
**No more typing struggles** – voice-first design for accessibility.  
**Trust through hybrid care** – AI + human doctors working together.  

**Biggest Challenge?**  
Making **LLaMA 70B** work efficiently with **few-shot learning** for Kinyarwanda—while keeping latency low.  

Huge thanks to my amazing team [@Teammate1], [@Teammate2], and mentors at [@Irembo] for pushing boundaries with us!  

**What’s next?** Scaling this to more languages—because **healthcare should meet people where they are.**
